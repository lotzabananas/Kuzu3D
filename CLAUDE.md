## Development Commands
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend servers
npm run dev

# Start only frontend (webpack dev server)
npm run dev:frontend

# Start only backend (KÃ¹zu API server)
npm run server

# If npm run dev fails, run servers in separate terminals:
# Terminal 1: npm run server
# Terminal 2: npm run dev:frontend

# The app runs on local network for Quest 3 testing
# Frontend: https://[local-ip]:8081
# Backend API: http://localhost:3000
```

## Testing
- Direct testing on Quest 3 headset via local network
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for WebXR)
- Hand tracking must be enabled in Quest settings

## Debugging on Quest
Since browser console is not accessible on Quest headset:
- Use remote logging via `/api/logs` endpoint
- View logs with: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/logs | jq`
- App sends debug info to server automatically
- Check logs for initialization errors and XR button creation

## Database Requirements
The application now requires a real KÃ¹zu database:
- Must provide a valid path to an existing KÃ¹zu database directory
- No mock or sample databases - real KÃ¹zu integration only
- Test database available at: `/Users/timmac/Desktop/Kuzu3D/test-kuzu-db`

## Current Challenges
1. Node movement needs to feel more natural and responsive
2. UI system needs refinement for better usability
3. Scaling visualization for large graphs
4. Implementing edge visualization between nodes

## Important Notes
- Always test on actual Quest 3 hardware (WebXR simulators don't fully replicate hand tracking)
- Passthrough mode is enabled by default for AR experience
- The app uses a simplified architecture (app-simple.js) for the proof of concept
- **Camera clipping behavior**:
  - VR mode: 100 unit far plane (nodes disappear beyond this for performance)
  - AR mode: 1000 unit far plane (10x larger to allow free exploration in physical space)

## Recent Work

## Current Gesture Controls
- **Left Pinch**: Grab individual nodes
- **Right Pinch**: Grab individual nodes / Confirm thumb menu selection
- **Double Pinch**: Scale and translate entire graph
- **Point (Index Extended)**: Ray-cast selection
- **Left Thumbs Up**: Activate thumb menu
- **Thumb Menu Option 2**: Activate/stop voice recording âœ…
- **Thumb Menu Option 3**: Toggle gentle drift (node separation) âœ…
- **Thumb Menu Option 4**: Instant spread (immediate node arrangement) âœ…
- **Fist**: Reserved for future use

## Thumb Menu Design Intent
- Menu appears 5cm in front of wrist, perpendicular to forearm
- Thumb rotation around forearm axis selects options (like turning a dial)
- Direct mapping: clockwise thumb = clockwise selection
- Right pinch confirms selection
- Menu locks in world space when activated for stability

## Voice Command System
The application supports natural language voice commands that fall into two categories:

### Query Commands (Database Queries)
These commands search and retrieve data from the KÃ¹zu database:
- **Keywords**: find, show, search, where, which, who, what
- **Examples**:
  - "Show me all people"
  - "Find who works at TechCorp"
  - "Show all relationships to Python"
  - "Which projects use Java?"
- **Processing**: Natural language â†’ OpenAI API â†’ Cypher query â†’ Database results â†’ 3D visualization

### Layout Commands (3D Arrangement)
These commands modify how nodes are displayed in 3D space:
- **Keywords**: arrange, group, cluster, organize, layout, position, spread, place
- **Examples**:
  - "Group the nodes together" - Reduces spacing between nodes
  - "Spread the nodes apart" - Increases spacing between nodes
  - "Organize the graph" - Applies instant spread algorithm
  - "Group employees around their companies" - Groups nodes by relationships
  - "Cluster people by the companies they work for" - Semantic grouping
  - "Arrange nodes in a circle" - Circular layout
  - "Show hierarchy" - Tree/hierarchical layout
- **Processing**: Natural language â†’ Layout interpretation â†’ Relationship analysis â†’ Animated positioning

#### Advanced Layout Features
- **Relationship-based grouping**: Automatically detects node types and relationships from your command
- **Schema-agnostic**: Works with any database schema by dynamically fetching node and relationship types
- **Multiple layout algorithms**:
  - Force-directed (default)
  - Grouping by relationships
  - Grouping by node type
  - Circular layouts
  - Hierarchical/tree layouts
- **Smooth animations**: 1-second eased transitions between layouts

### Voice Activation
- Press **Thumb Menu Option 2** to start/stop voice recording
- Real-time transcription appears in VR
- Commands are automatically processed when recording stops
- System automatically detects command type and routes appropriately

## Next Steps
1. Create Cypher query interface with VR keyboard
2. Add remaining thumb menu options (View modes, Filters, Settings)
3. Implement force-directed graph layout
4. Add voice commands for queries and navigation
5. Optimize rendering for graphs with 1000+ nodes
6. Add node search and filtering capabilities
7. Implement graph analytics (centrality, clustering, etc.)

## TODO
- Fix thumb menu labels to show text clearly (Legend, View, Filter, Settings) - currently only numbers are visible
- The legend table UI looks good but text needs to be properly aligned in the plane
- Fix edge label alignment:
  - Text should read ALONG the line (like text on a road)
  - Line should pass through left and right sides of text (----WORKS_AT----)
  - Text should flip/mirror when viewed from behind for readability
  - Should look similar to Kuzu Explorer's edge labels
  - Current issue: Text orientation is not aligning properly with line direction

## Known Issues
### Edge Label Alignment
- Text orientation not properly aligned with edge direction
- Labels should read along the line like road text
- Need to implement text flipping when viewed from behind

## Debug Mode
Debug mode hides development features like gesture indicators and thumb menu direction lines.

**Activation Methods:**
1. **Keyboard**: Press 'D' key (desktop only)
2. **Button**: Click "Toggle Debug Mode" button on home screen
3. **Gesture**: Double fist gesture (both hands make fists simultaneously)

**Hidden Features in Debug Mode:**
- Hand joint spheres and bones visualization
- Gesture state text displays
- Thumb menu direction indicator line
- Any other development/testing UI elements

## Database Connection
- **Path Required**: Enter full path to your KÃ¹zu database directory
- **Default**: `/Users/timmac/Desktop/Kuzu3D/test-kuzu-db` (auto-filled)
- **No Fallback**: Application requires real KÃ¹zu database - no mock data

## Test Database
A test KÃ¹zu database is created with `create-test-db.js`:
- 4 People: Alice (30), Bob (25), Charlie (35), Diana (28)
- 2 Companies: TechCorp (2010), DataSolutions (2015)
- WorksAt relationships with "since" properties
