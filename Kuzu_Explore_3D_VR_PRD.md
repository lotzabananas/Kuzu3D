# Product Requirements Document: Kùzu Explore 3D VR (Proof of Concept: Node Visualization)

## 1. Introduction & Goals

### 1.1 Define the Product Vision (Simplified)
The long-term vision is to create a rich, interactive 3D VR environment for exploring Kùzu graph databases. However, this initial Proof of Concept (PoC) focuses on the foundational step: establishing the capability to visualize a collection of Kùzu nodes in a 3D VR space to assess feasibility and visual impact.

### 1.2 Identify the Core Problem for this PoC
The immediate problem to solve is determining whether we can successfully extract node data from a Kùzu database and render these nodes as 3D objects in an immersive WebXR environment, and to gauge the initial visual appeal of such a representation.

### 1.3 Define Proof of Concept (PoC) Goals
*   **1.3.1 Node Data Loading:** Successfully connect to a user-provided local Kùzu database file and retrieve a list of nodes (e.g., their internal IDs or a primary key).
*   **1.3.2 Basic 3D Node Rendering:** Represent these extracted nodes as simple, identical 3D geometric primitives (e.g., spheres) within a WebXR scene.
*   **1.3.3 Minimal VR Viewing:** Allow a user to enter the WebXR environment and view the collection of rendered nodes, with very basic camera movement/viewpoint adjustment.

## 2. Target Audience (for PoC)

### 2.1 Primary Focus
The primary audience for this PoC is internal technical stakeholders (e.g., developers, project leads, and designers involved in the project). The goal is to validate the core technical approach and assess the visual potential to justify further development effort.

## 3. Core Features & Functionality (PoC)

### 3.1 Data Connection & Retrieval
*   **3.1.1 Local Kùzu Connection:** The application must provide a mechanism for the user to specify the path to a local Kùzu database file (or directory).
*   **3.1.2 Node Extraction:** The application will retrieve a collection of nodes from the specified database. For the PoC, this could be all nodes of a particular table/type or a predefined sample (e.g., the first N nodes). Edge data and node properties (beyond what's needed for simple existence) are out of scope.

### 3.2 3D Node Visualization
*   **3.2.1 Node Representation:** All nodes will be rendered as identical 3D spheres. A single default color and size will be used for all nodes.
*   **3.2.2 Node Display Detail:** No textual labels, pop-up properties, or any other detailed information will be displayed on or near the nodes. The focus is purely on their spatial presence as a collective.
*   **3.2.3 Initial Spatial Distribution:** Nodes will be distributed in the 3D space using a very simple algorithm (e.g., randomly positioned within a predefined spherical or cubic volume, or arranged in a basic 3D grid). No complex graph layout algorithms will be implemented for this PoC.

### 3.3 VR Navigation & Viewing (Minimal)
*   **3.3.1 VR Entry:** The user must be able to launch the application in a WebXR-compatible web browser and successfully enter VR mode.
*   **3.3.2 Basic Camera Control:** A very simple method for changing the viewpoint will be provided. This could be:
    *   Head-tracked rotation (standard in VR).
    *   Possibly one fixed teleportation point or a simple orbit camera around the center of the node cluster, controllable via a single button press on the VR controller.

## 4. Technical Considerations (PoC)

### 4.1 Target VR Platform
*   **WebXR:** The application will be developed as a WebXR application to ensure broad accessibility across VR headsets that support this standard via a web browser.

### 4.2 Development Stack
*   **3D Rendering:** Three.js (or a comparable WebGL library like Babylon.js) will be used for all 3D rendering, scene management, and WebXR integration.
*   **Kùzu Data Access:** A straightforward method to read basic node data from the Kùzu database file. Options include:
    *   Using Kùzu's official Node.js driver if it can be bundled or accessed by the web application (potentially via a minimal local server process).
    *   Exploring Kùzu's C++ API via WebAssembly (WASM) if feasible for direct client-side database reading for basic node list extraction.
    *   The simplest approach that allows extraction of a list of nodes will be prioritized.

## 5. Success Metrics (PoC)

### 5.1 Node Rendering
*   **Metric:** Successfully renders a target number of nodes (e.g., 100 to 500 nodes) from a sample Kùzu database as distinct 3D objects in the VR environment.
*   **Measurement:** Visual confirmation and ability to count/verify distinct node objects.

### 5.2 VR Experience Entry
*   **Metric:** The user can consistently launch the application and enter VR mode on a target test VR headset and browser.
*   **Measurement:** Successful transition to an immersive VR view displaying the 3D scene.

### 5.3 Basic Performance
*   **Metric:** The VR experience maintains a subjectively comfortable and stable frame rate (aiming for >45 FPS, ideally matching headset refresh rate) on the primary target test hardware when displaying the target number of nodes.
*   **Measurement:** Using browser developer tools (if available in VR mode) or VR performance overlays to monitor frame rates.

### 5.4 Visual "Coolness" Factor & Engagement
*   **Metric:** Informal feedback from the target audience (technical stakeholders) indicates that the visual representation of "nodes in space" is engaging, visually interesting, and shows clear promise for the concept.
*   **Measurement:** Collecting qualitative feedback through informal demonstrations and discussions.
